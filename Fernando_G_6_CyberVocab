sponsorships his team can recieve. His team has won over 15.7 billion dollars and it his held in a team bank account. He then reccieves an
email from the "bank" with them saying...

   Dear Jonathan G.
     
         We have recieved a notification that there was an online login from Moscow, Russia. Please click this link right 'here' to login 
         with your personal information and you will have to put in your account name, password, mothers maiden name, your first pets name,
         as well as your birth certificate & social sercuity number. Yes, this sounds like a lot of info to put in but don't worry, this is
         the offical president of your bank. 
         
        Thank you,
              Mr. Don Davis
